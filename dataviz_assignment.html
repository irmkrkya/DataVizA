			<!-- My first article starts here. It was hard to find articles related with Bosnian and Croatian refugees in serbia. It seems there is not much reporting on this years-long issue. That's why i picked the most recent UNHCR project called "The Regional Housing Program." I  find the story which was one of our reading assignments and followed the link to the original source. The project page has a number of announcements in Bosnia and Serbia. I picked reconstructions of houses in Bosnia and take the photo inside of that story.What i was so annoyed is that i didn't know how to put space between paragraphs but the gods of internet helped me and I applied it basically every place possible. I used the image size, color and frame as we did in the class because I was afraid to mss it up.

					According to the UNHCR report, a total of 101 million euros from the Regional Housing Program has been committed to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Funding has been used to build homes for 5, 400 returnees, refugees and internally displaced people in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As part of the project, Serbia laid the foundation stone for the construction of the 235 apartments in last September. The project's Serbian part is expected to resolve the housing problems of more than 45,000 people who are living in Serbia.

						Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has been convicted of genocide and war crimes in the Bosnian war, and sentenced to 40 years in jail in last March. His conviction caused mixed reactions among Bosniaks and Serbs. While some people welcomed the court rule, others emphasized that I will never be enough to heal the wounds that the war created in both sides.

			More than 35 thousand refugees from Croatia and Bosnia are still displaced in Serbia, according to Danish Refugee Council.
		</p>
		<p>
			There were nine collective centers in the country as of January of last year and these centers were hosting 185 Refugees from Croatia and Bosnia and 375 Internally Displaced Persons from Kosovo the council reported. According to Danish Refugee Council, refugees have been often living in poor conditions and without an adequate alternative housing solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			“The number of refugees continues to reduce as a result of the local integration and return projects, as well as the Regional Housing Programme. Even though the process of voluntary repatriation has not yet been completed, it is assumed that the majority of refugees have opted for local integration,” Danish Refugee Council, says.

		<!-- My first article starts here. It was hard to find articles related with Bosnian and Croatian refugees in serbia. It seems there is not much reporting on this years-long issue. That's why i picked the most recent UNHCR project called "The Regional Housing Program." I  find the story which was one of our reading assignments and followed the link to the original source. The project page has a number of announcements in Bosnia and Serbia. I picked reconstructions of houses in Bosnia and take the photo inside of that story.What i was so annoyed is that i didn't know how to put space between paragraphs but the gods of internet helped me and I applied it basically every place possible. I used the image size, color and frame as we did in the class because I was afraid to mss it up.

				The Regional Housing Program has been providing housing to people who fled Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1990 Balkan wars.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				According to the UNHCR report, a total of 101 million euros from the Regional Housing Program has been committed to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Funding has been used to build homes for 5, 400 returnees, refugees and internally displaced people in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As part of the project, Serbia laid the foundation stone for the construction of the 235 apartments in last September. The project's Serbian part is expected to resolve the housing problems of more than 45,000 people who are living in Serbia.

			<p>
				During the conflicts of the 1990s, around 2.2 million people from Bosnia was displaced or become refugees. The number of displaced people was believed to be around 550,000 in Croatia and 540,000 in Serbia.

		<!-- Again, as I have had difficulties in finding current stories on my research assignment, I thought a reaction piece on Karadzic verdict could be interesting, altough it is not directly related with the refugee. I got the first photo from New York Times website, trusting their photo choice. The second image is a famous one and I thought it would be good match to use Karadzic photo in the same story.

				Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has been convicted of genocide and war crimes in the Bosnian war, and sentenced to 40 years in jail in last March. His conviction caused mixed reactions among Bosniaks and Serbs. While some people welcomed the court rule, others emphasized that I will never be enough to heal the wounds that the war created in both sides.

				Edna Siljdedic, 20 year-old Bosniak woman, and her family moved to San Francisco as refugees after the war. She expressed excitement about the verdict.“It's easy to be a pessimist, but today's conviction of Radovan Karadzic gives me hope. Despite war and genocide, we continue to stay strong and to live,” Siljdedic said.

			Daniel Milosevic, 34 year-old Bosnian Serb, lives in Ohio, said the verdict is step backwards for the reconciliation of the nation and contributes the feeling that Serbs have about their side of story was never told.
			“This verdict won't change anything. I think that wounds will never heal back home,” he noted.
